# ape-game
This was an assignment in our Next Generation Technology 1 module in First Year.
We were given the HTML and CSS and had to write the JavaScript to get the simple game to work.

The original instructions were the following:
>Create a simple game, as follows. You are given a web page fragment with a HTML table with three rows and three columns. At any time, all cells of the table are empty except one cell which contains an image. 
>
>Create a JavaScript function `moveImgRandomly()` which removes the image from its current cell and puts it into a random cell of the table (determine the target cell with the help of `Math.random()`).
>
>`moveImgRandomly()` should be called every 200ms, using `setInterval`.
>
>Furthermore, attach an event handler to the image so that each time the user clicks on the image, an alert window with message “Caught!” pops up.
>
>Do not use `innerHTML` or any other functions which accept HTML code as an argument.
